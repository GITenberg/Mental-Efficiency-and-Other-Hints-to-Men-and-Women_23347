description: In this delightful collection of practical essays, published in 1911,
  the author observes that "the fault of the epoch is the absence of meditativeness."
  He instructs us to attend to our mental state as vigorously as we do our physical
  health in chapters entitled "Mental Calisthenics, Breaking with the Past and "The
  Secret of Content, (when the mind acknowledges something higher than itself). In
  "Marriage and Success" marriage is seen as a personal affair rather than a duty
  owed to the State.
